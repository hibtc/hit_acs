# Of these, we only disrespect the rules:
# - E126 continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# - E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
# - E241 multiple spaces after ':' [or ',']
# - W503 line break before binary operator
# - W504 line break after binary operator
# Additionally, we disrespect:
# - E221 multiple spaces before operator
# Differing from the default, we currently follow and don't ignore:
# - E121 continuation line under-indented for hanging indent
# - E123 closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracket’s line
# - E133 closing bracket is missing indentation
# - E242 tab after ‘,’
# - E704 multiple statements on one line (def)
# - W505 doc line too long (82 > 79 characters)
# Our maximum line length is designed to exactly fit two terminals side-by-side
# on my laptop screen and because the default is too small in so many cases.
